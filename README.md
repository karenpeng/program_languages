<p>This course will guide students through the art and science of designing a programming language. This will include writing parsers, compilers and interpreters as well as discussing and exploring different ways of structuring thought on a machine. Students will also explore the history of code, with particular focus on languages no longer in common use that presented radically different ways of thinking about code. These languages will be discussed, used, and dissected as a source of inspiration and study for the new languages that will be developed in the class.</p>
